Scanner Documentation
=====================

:class:`Scanner` is a utility designed to help you carry out lexical,
regex-based scanning operations on strings. There's also
:func:`~strscan.text_coords`, which is a handy function for resolving simple
string indices into textual co-ordinates (line number and column).
